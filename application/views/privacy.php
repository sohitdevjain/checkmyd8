                    <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>Note: We collect and use your information below to provide our services and to measure and improve them over time.</p>
                    <p><strong>Basic Account Information</strong>When you create or reconfigure a CheckMyD8.com account, you provide some personal information, such an username, Date of birth, password, phone number and email address. When you complete a profile with CheckMyD8 we will ask for your consent to keep the information and upload a CheckMyD8 Background Check.

                    <p><strong>Cookies</strong>
                    Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our services, but we do not require cookies for most parts of our services such as searching and looking at a background check. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk. CheckMyD8.com may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our services, and to customise and improve our services. We will require consent from you if your cookies are needed. </p>
                    <p><strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong>Note We do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances described here.</p>
                    <p><strong>Law and Harm</strong>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect CheckMyD8.com’s rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.</p>

                    <p><strong>Business Transfers and Affiliates</strong>In the event that CheckMyD8.com is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information about you to our corporate affiliates (in the form of anonymous data) in order to help provide, understand, and improve our services and our affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.</p>
                    <p><strong>Modifying Your Personal Information</strong>If you are a registered user of our services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account.</p>
                    <p><strong>Right to be forgotten</strong>In the case that you wish to no longer appear on CheckMyD8 and for us to hold your information you can follow the deactivation process which then removes your profile and all existing information that we may hold.</p>
                    <p><strong>Our Policy Towards Children</strong>Our Services are not directed to persons under 18. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at privacy@checkmyd8.com. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18 as they are unable to give as valid consent. If we become aware that a child under 18 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child’s account. </p>
                    <p><strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong>
                    CheckMyD8.com complies with the GDPR Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.</p>
